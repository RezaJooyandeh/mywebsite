					<div>My PhD Research</div>
					<div>
						During my PhD program, I was working on <b>isomorph-free exhaustive generation of graphs</b>. It might sound complicated, but it is not!
						If you want to undrestand what it is, that is enough to read this <span style="color: Green"><b><i>non-technical</i></b></span> page!

					<div>What do I mean by "graph"?</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							A <b>graph</b> is a mathematical model for presenting a set of objects and relations between them.
							The objects and relations between them are usually visualised with some points and links (lines or arcs) between them.
							The points and the links are called <b>vertices</b> and <b>edges</b> in the language of mathematics.
							For example <span style="background-color: #3B5998; color: White; font-weight: bold">Facebook</span> can be considered as a graph in which people are the vertices and there is an edge between two people if they are friend.
							The following image can represents a graph of 5 friends which has 5 vertices and 10 edges (each two persons are friend with each other).
						</p>
						<img src="images/k5.png" style="margin: 0 auto; display: block;" alt="A complete graph with 5 vertices." />
						<p>
							There are many families of graphs like <b>regular graphs</b> (graphs in which each vertex is related to the same number of vertices),
							<b>planar graphs</b> (graphs which can be drawn on a plane without edge crossing), <b>bipartite graphs</b> (graphs whose nodes can be divided
							in two parts and there is no edge between any two verteices of each part and etc. Undrestanding of each family of graphs
							has its own theoretical and practical purposes.

					<div>Graph Generation</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							Graph generation is one of the branches of combinatorics which is interesting not only for combinatorists, but also other specialists
							because of its wide applications in other fields like
							<span style="color: Green">Network Design</span>,
							<span style="color: Green">Chemistry</span>,
							<span style="color: Green">Nano-Technology</span> and
							<span style="color: Green">Numerical Analysis</span>. The first work on this field was done by de Veris in 1891 who was a chemist.
						</p>
						<p>
							For a family of graphs like <b><i>F</i></b> we say that it can be <b>recursively generated</b> from a set of <b>initial graphs</b> and
							a collection of operations each of which convert some members of <b><i>F</i></b> to some other members of it if:
						</p>
						<ol>
							<li>Any of the initial graphs are in the family.</li>
							<li>Any graph in the family can be constructed from an initial graph with some applications of the operations.</li>
						</ol>
					</div>
				</div>

				<div class="MyPanel NormalPanel">
					<div>Graph Isomorphism</div>
					<div>
						Two graphs are called <b>isomorphic</b> if they can represent each others. Let's see what does it mean with an example. Consider these three cases:
						<ol>
							<li>Tom, Jack and Michelle are <b>friends</b> while Boris is just <b>friend</b> with Tom.</li>
							<li>Boris, Tom and Jack have <b>seen</b> Paris. Boris and Jack also have <b>visited</b> Rome.</li>
							<li>There is a <b>direct flight</b> between any two of Sydney, Tokyo and Beijing but the only <b>direct flights</b> to Canberra is from Sydney.</li>
						</ol>
						Let's make a graph for each case.
						<ol>
							<li>Tom, Jack, Michelle and Boris are <b>objects</b> while <b>friendship</b> is relation between them.</li>
							<li>Tom, Jack, Michelle and Boris are <b>objects</b> while two of them are related if both of them <b>have seen a city</b>.</li>
							<li>Sydney, Tokyo, Beijing and Canberra are <b>objects</b> while two of them are related if <b>there is a direct flight</b> between them.</li>
						</ol>
						The visualisation of the these graphs can be:
						
						<div class="wide" style="margin: 10px;">
							<div class="table-if-not-xs wide" style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
								<div>
									<img src="images/g1.png" alt="Graph 1" />
									<br />
									<b>Graph 1</b>
								</div>
								<div>
									<img src="images/g2.png" alt="Graph 2" />
									<br />
									<b>Graph 2</b>
								</div>
								<div>
									<img src="images/g3.png" alt="Graph 3" />
									<br />
									<b>Graph 3</b>
								</div>
							</div>
						</div>
						Now we see that the graphs of all three cases is almost the same. The only difference between them is that the name of vertices are different.
						These kind of graphs which can be converted to each other by relabeling vertices are called <b>isomorphic</b>.

				<div class="MyPanel SpecialPanel6">
					<div>So what is isomorphism-free exhuasive generation of graphs?</div>
					<div>
						<p>
							<b>Isomorph-free exhaustive generation</b> of a family graphs means <b>generating</b> the <b>entire (exhaustive)</b> family of those graphs in a way that
							<b>no pair</b> of the generated graphs are <b>isomorphic</b>. The importance of isomorph-free generation that as a model there is no difference
							between two isomorph graphs so having isomorph graphs is redundant and also generally a graph, specially the big ones, can have exponentially so many isomorph versions (even with a fixed set of possible labels).
							So practically having so many redundant data can make the generation algorithm useless.
